We aim to determine the quark-gluon-plasma initial conditions created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions and its temperature dependent transport coefficients utilizing Bayesian statistics and a multi-parameter model-to-data comparison.
The study is performed using \trento\ a recently developed parametric initial condition model for relativistic nuclear collisions which is able to interpolate among a general class of saturation based particle production scenarios [?].
The parameterization is compared to explicit calculations in Color-Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory and embedded in a realistic hybrid model which couples event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics to a hadronic cascade.
We find that the parameterized initial conditions are highly constrained by bulk observables and provide a first set of constraints on the temperature dependence of the specific shear- and bulk-viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma.

\section{Introduction}

Simulations based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamics have been highly successful describing a wealth of bulk observables in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven, NY and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. Initially, the success of hydrodynamic simulations was primarily qualitative. The framework elegantly described a number experimental phenomena, for example the existence of large azimuthal particle correlations, the mass ordering of these correlations and their characteristic momentum dependence.

Modern hydrodynamic simulations have greatly improved upon the successes of first-generation models. The addition of dissipative corrections to ideal hydrodynamics, event-by-event fluctuations in the colliding nuclei and modern lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations for the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) equation of state are just a few examples of developments which have dramatically improved the agreement of hydrodynamic models with experiment.

These developments have positioned hydrodynamic modeling to evolve beyond a qualitative science and extract intrinsic properties of hot and dense QCD matter with quantitative uncertainties. A primary goal of the ongoing effort is to determine the temperature dependence of the QGP transport coefficients such as the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ which is theorized to reach a lower bound ${(\eta/s)(T) \ge 1/4\pi}$ near the QGP phase transition temperature. 

A prominent source of uncertainty in determining QGP transport coefficients from hydrodynamic model-to-data comparison is in modeling the initial stages of the collision. Model predictions vary with the choice of initial conditions and hence prefer hydrodynamic transport coefficients, e.g.\ QGP shear and bulk viscosities, which differ from calculation to calculation. For example, an estimate of the effective (constant) QGP shear viscosity $(\eta/s)_\text{QGP}$ needed to fit spectra and flows at RHIC found ${1/4\pi \le (\eta/s)_\text{QGP} \le 2.5/4\pi}$, where the uncertainty was largely attributable to a factor of two discrepancy in $(\eta/s)_\text{QGP}$ extracted with two different hydrodynamic initial condition models. 

The ongoing effort to constrain current bounds on the QGP shear viscosity typically focuses on improving theoretical descriptions of the initial conditions as well as the addition of new sensitive observables to assess the validity of each model's inherent assumptions and approximations. The process thus defines an iterative cycle in which theory calculations are embedded in hydrodynamic transport simulations and analyzed against a comprehensive list of bulk observables to determine the likelihood distributions of the model parameters.

Model optimization and comparison is complicated by the high-dimensional nature of the underconstrained parameter space. In addition to free parameters which describe the QGP transport coefficients, hydrodynamic simulations depend on a number of auxiliary parameters such as an effective nucleon width, QGP thermalization time and chemical freezeout temperature which require simultaneous optimization. Evaluating hydrodynamic models at a single point in parameter space may require tens of thousand of hydrodynamic simulations and thus brute force optimization techniques quickly become intractable. 

One solution to the model optimization problem is the use of modern Bayesian methods designed to tune computationally intensive models which depend on free parameters that live in large and highly correlated parameter spaces. A given model is first evaluated using a relatively small number of parameter configurations corresponding to discrete points in parameter space, and the model evaluations are used to train a Gaussian process emulator which interpolates model predictions between the training points. A standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then be used to explore the parameter space interpolated by the emulator and isolate regions of parameter space which optimally replicate experiment. 

Bayesian methods have been applied in previous studies to hydrodynamic simulations initialized with a two-component Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb.) model and initial conditions derived from Color Glass Condensate effective field theory using the Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model. Future studies might expand this coverage to more modern calculations of the QGP initial conditions in order to systematically constrain hydrodynamic transport coefficients and auxiliary parameters for each initialization model described in the literature. Once the models are appropriately optimized, the accuracy of the different theory calculations can be assessed using an appropriately chosen goodness of fit measure or, as typically used in Bayesian methodology, an integrated likelihood that a given model describes experiment. 

An alternative approach to this method of direct model validation is to parameterize the QGP initial conditions and apply Bayesian parameter estimation to determine systematic constraints on the initial energy (or entropy) deposited by competing models. The approach was first introduced in a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC which constrained parameterized forms of the event-averaged initial conditions and temperature dependence of the QGP equation of state using viscous hydrodynamics coupled to a hadronic afterburner. The authors parameterized the initial conditions using a saturation inspired mapping similar to an optical wounded nucleon model but with additional parameters to incorporate modifications to particle production expected in Color-Glass Condensate effective field theory.

In this work we extend previous efforts to parameterize and constrain the QGP initial conditions using \trento , a recently developed parametric initial condition model designed to interpolate a subspace of all initialization models, including, but not limited to, parameterizations that mimic specific calculations in Color-Glass Condensate effective field theory. The parametric model generalizes trivially to incorporate fluctuations of the nucleon coordinates and minimum bias proton-proton yields and is used to conduct the first Bayesian analysis of QGP initial conditions which parameterizes both the magnitude of event-by-event fluctuations and the strength of saturation effects which modulate average particle production. We show that the experimental data imparts simultaneous constraints on the QGP initial conditions and medium properties, and compare these constraints to specific calculations in the literature.  

\section{Modeling the QGP evolution}

Staggered lines show different cross sections of the initial entropy density $dS/(d^2r_\perp dy)$ as a function of the nucleon density $T_A$ for several values of $T_B = 1, 2, 3$ [fm$^{-2}$].} 
\end{figure*}

The heavy-ion collision transport dynamics are modeled in a multi-stage approach which uses relativistic viscous hydrodynamics for the time-evolution of the QGP medium and a microscopic Boltzmann equation to simulate the dynamics of the system after hadronization. 

\subsection{Hydrodynamics and Boltzmann transport}
The hydrodynamic evolution is solved using an improved version of VISH2+1, a stable, extensively tested implementation of boost-invariant viscous hydrodynamics which has been updated to handle fluctuating event-by-event initial conditions and incorporate bulk viscous corrections with shear and bulk coupling. The equations of motion are described by the second-order Israel-Stewart equations in the 14-moment approximation which yields a set of relaxation equations
\begin{subequations}
\label{relaxation}
\begin{align}
    \tau_\Pi \Pi + \dot{\Pi} =& -\zeta \theta - \delta_{\Pi\Pi} \Pi\theta + \phi_1 \Pi^2 + \lambda_{\Pi\pi} \pi^{\mu\nu} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \nonumber \\ 
   &+\phi_3 \pi^{\mu\nu}\pi_{\mu\nu}, \\
    \tau_\pi \dot{\pi}^{\langle \mu\nu \rangle} + \pi^{\mu\nu} =& ~2\eta\sigma^{\mu\nu} + 2\pi_\alpha^{\langle \mu} w^{\nu \rangle \alpha} - \delta_{\pi\pi} \pi^{\mu\nu} \theta \phi_7 \pi_\alpha^{\langle \mu} \pi^{\nu \rangle \alpha} \nonumber \\
&-\tau_{\pi\pi} \pi_\alpha^{\langle \mu}\sigma^{\nu \rangle \alpha} + \lambda_{\pi\Pi} \Pi \sigma^{\mu\nu} + \phi_6 \Pi \pi^{\mu\nu},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
for the bulk viscous pressure $\Pi$ and shear-stress tensor $\pi^{\mu\nu}$. The terms $\zeta$ and $\eta$ are the first-order bulk and shear transport coefficients, and the parameters $\tau_\Pi$ and $\tau_\pi$ their second-order bulk and shear relaxation times. The remaining transport coefficients multiplying shear and bulk terms on the right can then be expressed as functions of the relaxation times and other thermodynamic quantities and have been determined in the limit of small but finite masses in reference \ref{?}.

The relaxation equations in Eq.\eqref{relaxation} are then used to solve the hydrodynamic evolution equations,
\begin{equation}
\label{conservation}
\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0, \quad T^{\mu\nu} = e u^\mu u^\nu  - \Delta^{\mu\nu} (P_0 + \Pi) + \pi^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
for the energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$, provided a set of initial conditions for the energy density $e(x,y)$ and four-velocity $u^\mu(x,y)$ as well as an equation of state to interrelate the energy density $e$, ideal pressure $P_0$ and temperature $T$ of each fluid cell in local thermal equilibrium.

We use a modern QCD equation of state (EoS) based on continuum extrapolated lattice calculations at zero baryon density published by the HotQCD collaboration and blended into a hadron resonance gas EoS in the interval $110 \le T \le 130$ MeV using a smoothstep interpolation function. The HotQCD EoS, characterized by the parameterized interaction measure $\theta^{\mu\mu}(T) = (e - 3p)/T^4$, has been compared to additional state-of-the-art calculations by the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration and shown to agree within published errors. The two parameterizations were also studied in a recent error analysis at RHIC energies which quantified the effect of systematic lattice EoS discrepancies and statistical continuum extrapolation errors on hydrodynamic observables. The effect of these errors on mean $p_T$, elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ was found to be order 1\% and hence is expected to be negligible in the present analysis.

We seek to constrain, among other quantities, the temperature dependence of the shear and bulk transport coefficients $\eta(T)$ and $\zeta(T)$ in Eq.~\eqref{relaxation}. The QGP specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ is qualitatively expected to reach a global minimum near the QGP phase transition temperature and hence is parameterized using a simple form,
\begin{equation}
(\eta/s)(T) = 
\begin{cases}
    (\eta/s)_\text{min} + (\eta/s)_\text{slope} \cdot (T - T_c) &T > T_c \\
    (\eta/s)_\text{hrg} &T \le T_c
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we fix $T_c = 0.155$ GeV using the approximate pseudo-critical phase transition temperature of the HotQCD equation of state, and $(\eta/s)_\text{min}$, $(\eta/s)_\text{slope}$ and $(\eta/s)_\text{hrg}$ are constants which we wish to determine. For the temperature dependent bulk viscosity, we use the parameterization constructed in Ref.~\ref{?},
\begin{equation}
    \label{zetas}
    (\zeta/s)(T) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \begin{aligned}
            C_1 &+ \lambda_1 \exp [(x-1)/\sigma_1]  \\ &+ \lambda_2 \exp [ (x-1)/\sigma_2]
        \end{aligned}

        &T < T_a \\[3ex]
        A_0 + A_1 x + A_2 x^2 &T_a \le T \le T_b \\[2ex]

        \begin{aligned}
            C_2 &+ \lambda_3 \exp [-(x-1)/\sigma_3]  \\ &+ \lambda_4 \exp [-(x-1)/\sigma_4]
        \end{aligned}
        &T > T_b

    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
with dimensionless parameter $x = T/T_0$ and parameterization coefficients
\begin{align*}
    &C_1=0.03, ~~C_2=0.001, \\ 
    &A_0=-13.45, ~~A_1=27.55, ~~A_2=-13.77, \\
    &\sigma_1=0.0025, ~~\sigma_2=0.022, ~~\sigma_3=0.025, ~~\sigma_4=0.13, \\
    &\lambda_1=0.9, ~~\lambda_2=0.22, ~~\lambda_3=0.9, ~~\lambda_4=0.25, \\
    &T_0 = 0.18 \text{ GeV}, ~~T_a = 0.995\, T_0, ~~T_b = 1.05\, T_0.
\end{align*}
The $(\zeta/s)(T)$ curve in Eq.~\eqref{zetas} is then rescaled by an overall normalization factor $(\zeta/s)_\text{norm}$ which is a free parameter to be constrained by data. 

The hybrid model used in the present analysis switches from hydrodynamic field equations to a microscopic kinetic description of the medium once the fluid expands, cools and hadronizes. Kinetic descriptions are well suited to describe late stages of the collision where the inter-particle mean free path approaches the system size and approximate local thermal equillibirum breaks down. Kinetic models also naturally describe species dependent kinetic freezeout and hadronic feed down dynamics which are difficult to incorporate in purely hydrodynamic models. More detailed discussion of the advantages of hybrid models can be found in references \ref{?}.

The transition from viscous hydrodynamics to a hadronic cascade is performed along a constant isotherm $T_\text{sw}$ using the iSS particle sampler according to the Cooper-Frye prescription,
\begin{equation}
    \label{cooper_frye}
    \frac{dN}{dy p_T dp_T d\phi_p} = \int_\Sigma \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} (f_0(x,p) + \delta f(x,p)) p^\mu d^3 \sigma_\mu,
\end{equation}
where $E$ and $p$ are the energy and momentum of the sampled particle, $f_0$ the ideal distribution function, $\delta f$ its viscous corrections and where $d^3\sigma_\mu$ is an element of the isothermal freezeout surface $\Sigma$.

In general, the viscous corrections to the distribution function $\delta f(x, p)$ in Eq.~\eqref{cooper_frye} include both shear and bulk contributions. The shear correction to the distribution function is given by,
\begin{equation}
    \delta f_\text{shear}(x^\mu, p^\mu) = f_0(x^\mu, p^\mu)(1 \pm f_0(x^\mu, p^\mu))\frac{\pi_{\mu\nu}p^\mu p^\nu}{2(e+P)T^2}
\end{equation}
where $f_0$ is the ideal distribution function, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ the shear stress tensor, $p^\mu$ the particle momentum and $e$, $P$ and $T$ the fluid's energy density, pressure and temperature. The bulk viscous correction, on the other hand, is described by multiple formulations in the literature which predict significantly different behaviour when either the bulk viscosity $\zeta$ or the transverse momentum $p_T$ are large. We note, however, that since the bulk parameterization $(\zeta/s)(T)$ in Eq.~\eqref{zetas} is small in the allowed hydro-to-micro transition region $135 \le T_\text{sw} \le 165$~MeV used in this study, that the bulk viscous corrections $\delta f_\text{bulk} \propto (\zeta/s)\vert_{T_\text{sw}}$ are also expected to be small and are neglected in the present work.

Once the fluid is converted into hadrons, the subsequent microscopic dynamics are modeled using the UrQMD hadronic afterburner. The UrQMD model solves a numerical implementation of the relativistic Boltzmann equation,
\begin{equation}
2=2
\end{equation}
%State-of-the-art heavy-ion collision models simulate QGP spacetime evolution in several stages \cite{Bass:2000ib,Teaney:2001av,Hirano:2005xf,Nonaka:2006yn,Petersen:2008dd,Song:2010mg,Schenke:2010rr,Shen:2014vra}:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item an initial condition model describes the initial state and non-equilibrium dynamics until QGP formation,
%  \item viscous relativistic hydrodynamics calculates the dynamical expansion of the hot and dense QGP medium including the phase transition to a hadron gas,
%  \item then a particlization model converts the system into a microscopic ensemble of hadrons,
%  \item and finally a Boltzmann transport model calculates hadronic rescattering and decays.
%\end{enumerate}
%In this work, we opt for a mature, well-tested set of event-by-event models \cite{Shen:2014vra} for the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP and subsequent microscopic evolution of the hadronic phase. The initial condition will be provided by a novel parametric approach \cite{}.

At this point we briefly recapitulate the free parameters enumerated thus far which describe the hydrodynamic evolution of the produced QGP:

The solid blue line shows an example of a discrete mapping specified by a generalized mean with $p=0$.} 
\end{figure}

Ab-initio initial state models allow for the dynamical calculation of thermalization
and QGP formation and provide the initial conditions for the subsequent hydrodynamic 
evolution of the QGP \cite{}. A rigorous test of these models requires their integration
into a description for the full time-evolution of the heavy-ion collision that includes 
formation of the QGP, hydrodynamic evolution, hadronization and hadronic final state 
interactions. This can become computationally very challenging, given that the 
sizeable computational cost of calculating the early time off-equilibrium evolution adds 
onto the very significant computational effort required for the event-by-event evolution 
of the QGP and its decay products.

In this paper we will pursue an alternative method for determining the initial condition
of the hydrodynamic evolution, utilizing Bayesian statistics and a multi-parameter 
model to data comparison. With the help of a parametric initial condition model, Trento, we aim to
provide a likelihood distribution for the features of the initial condition that are 
compatible with the data taken at the LHC. The resulting high likelihood 
initial conditions can then be compared to the outcome of ab-initio initial state and 
early-time dynamical models at the time of QGP formation, thus providing valuable 
insight into their viability without the need for a full initial-to-final-state model 
calculation.


At this time, we take a moment to briefly summarize the model and enumerate the free parameters used to model the initial conditions and QGP evolution.
