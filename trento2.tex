  We implement a recently developed parametric initial condition model for relativistic nuclear collisions designed to interpolate among a general class of saturation based initial state models [?]. The model is compared to explicit calculations in Color-Glass Condensate effective field theory and embedded in a realistic hybrid model which couples event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics to a hadronic cascade in order to constrain free parameters of the model. We find that initial entropy deposition and particle production scale with the geometric mean of participant nuclear thickness $dS/dy \sim \sqrt{T_A T_B}$.

\section{Introduction}

Simulations based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamics have been highly successful describing a wealth of bulk observables in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven, NY and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. Initially, the success of hydrodynamic simulations was primarily qualitative. The framework elegantly described a number experimental phenomena, for example the existence of large azimuthal momentum correlations, the mass ordering of these correlations and their characteristic momentum dependence.

Modern hydrodynamic simulations have greatly improved upon the successes of first-generation models. The addition of dissipative corrections to ideal hydrodynamics, event-by-event fluctuations in the colliding nuclei and modern lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations for the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) equation of state are just a few examples of developments which have dramatically improved the agreement of hydrodynamic models with experiment.

These developments have positioned hydrodynamic modeling to evolve beyond a qualitative science and extract intrinsic properties of hot and dense QCD matter with quantitative uncertainties. A primary goal of the ongoing effort is to determine the temperature dependence of the QGP transport coefficients such as the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ which is theorized to reach a lower bound ${(\eta/s)(T) \ge 1/4\pi}$ near the QGP phase transition temperature. 

The dominant source of uncertainty in determining QGP transport coefficients from hydrodynamic model-to-data comparison is in modeling the initial stages of the collision. Model predictions vary with the choice of initial conditions and hence prefer hydrodynamic transport coefficients, e.g.\ QGP shear and bulk viscosities, which differ from calculation to calculation. For example, an estimate of the effective (constant) QGP shear viscosity $(\eta/s)_\text{QGP}$ needed to fit spectra and flows at RHIC found ${1/4\pi \le (\eta/s)_\text{QGP} \le 2.5/4\pi}$, where the uncertainty was largely attributable to a factor of two discrepancy in $(\eta/s)_\text{QGP}$ extracted with two different hydrodynamic initial condition models. 

The ongoing effort to constrain current bounds on the QGP shear viscosity typically focuses on improving theoretical descriptions of the initial conditions as well as the addition of new sensitive observables to assess the validity of each models' inherent assumptions and approximations. The process thus defines an iterative cycle in which theory calculations are embedded in hydrodynamic transport simulations and analyzed against a comprehensive list of bulk observables to determine the model's quality of fit and experimental consistency.

Model optimization and comparison is complicated by the high-dimensional nature of the underconstrained parameter space. In addition to free parameters which describe the QGP transport coefficients, hydrodynamic simulations depend on a number of auxiliary parameters such as the effective nucleon width, QGP thermalization time and chemical freezeout temperature which require simultaneous optimization. Correlations among these parameters remain poorly understood and obfuscate efforts to find optimal parameters for each initial condition model.

\subsection{Parametric initial conditions}

Typically, the initial conditions are calculated within a specific effective theory, subject to a number of assumptions and related approximations. Model predictions vary with the choice of initial conditions and hence prefer hydrodynamic transport coefficients, e.g.\ QGP shear and bulk viscosities, which differ from calculation to calculation.
Historically, these initial conditions have been generated by one of two means: either from a two-component Glauber ansatz which asserts an admixture of soft and hard collision processes or from specific calculations in Color-Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. 


Despite the phenomenological approach of the two-component Glauber model which is tuned to fit experiment, it was quickly realized that there is no binary collision fraction which can replicate the behavior of particle production in CGC based initial condition models. For instance, the Monte Carlo Glauber model (MC-Glb.) predicts profiles of entropy (or energy) which are less elliptic than CGC based Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model predict profil


eccentricity harmonics. The MC-KLN model produces profiles of energy and entropy which are more elliptic than MC-Glb.\ calculations and hence predicts more elliptic flow in ideal hydrodynamic simulations. Consequently, the KLN model necessitates a constant QGP shear viscosity which is

 and hence requires larger shear viscous corrections than the MC-Glb.\ model to fit the same experimental data.
Hydrodynamic simulations are typically initialized using one of two approaches: simplistic parameteric

    \includegraphics{posterior_integrated}
    \caption{Presentation is identical to Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_identified}, but with charged particle yields replacing identified pion, kaon and proton yields in the calibration process. The resulting posterior distributions are generally less constrained, and several marginal distributions along the diagonal are affected noticeably (see Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_comparison} for a direct comparison). For example, the initial condition normalization increases significantly (top-left panel) and the hydro-to-urqmd switching temperature is completely washed out (bottom-right panel). $^\dagger$The units for $\eta/s$ slope are [GeV$^{-1}$]. }
