\begin{abstract}
  We implement a recently developed parametric initial condition model for relativistic nuclear collisions designed to interpolate among a general class of saturation based initial state models [?]. The model is compared to explicit calculations in Color-Glass Condensate effective field theory and embedded in a realistic hybrid model which couples event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics to a hadronic cascade in order to constrain free parameters of the model. We find that initial entropy deposition and particle production scale with the geometric mean of participant nuclear thickness $dS/dy \sim \sqrt{T_A T_B}$.

\section{Introduction}

% introduce QGP and relativistic hydro
Measurements of the bulk properties of final state particles produced by ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions indicate that hot and dense QCD matter behaves as a 
strongly interacting system of deconfined quarks and gluons known as a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Relativistic fluid dynamic simulations have been highly successful
in describing the large degree of collectivity observed in these collisions, most notably the existence of azimuthal correlations in particle yields understood to arise
when particles are emitted from a commonly flowing source.

% state the goal/value of hydro modeling, why do it?
These hydrodynamic mod provide an attractive framework to study the intrinsic properties of hot and dense QCD matter by relating global, extrinsic properties of QGP transport
described by late-time experimental observables to intrinsic properties of the QGP such as its equation of state and hydrodynamic transport coefficients.


Hydrodynamic models and related transport theories provide a necessary link between the ephemeral, early-time dynamics of the QGP droplet and the asymptotic 
bound states measured by experiment. Provided realistic initial conditions, the QCD equation of state and values for the dissipative transport coefficients, the hydrodynamic equations of motion specify the full time-evolution the QGP medium which can be used to evolve the.

    \caption{Profiles of the initial thermal distribution predicted by the KLN (left), EKRT (middle) and wounded nucleon (right) models (dashed black lines) compared to a generalized mean with different values of the parameter $p$ (solid blue lines). Staggered lines show different cross sections of the initial entropy density $dS/(d^2r_\perp dy)$ as a function of the nucleon density $T_A$ for several values of $T_B = 1, 2, 3$ [fm$^{-2}$].}

    \includegraphics{thickness}
    \caption{Cross section of the participant nucleon density in a mid-central Pb+Pb collision at $\sqrts=2.76$ TeV as a function of the transverse coordinate $x$ parallel to impact parameter $\vec{b}$. The gray band indicates the region bounded by the minimum and maximum values of the local participant thickness functions $T_A$ and $T_B$, while the blue band indicates the region spanned by the generalized mean of $T_A$ and $T_B$ with parameter $-1<p<1$. The solid blue line shows an example of a discrete mapping specified by a generalized mean with $p=0$.}

The horizontal axis shows predictions by the emulator at untested regions of parameter space, and the vertical axis shows the same quantity after it has been calculated directly from the model. The gray line indicates perfect model and emulator agreement.}

    \caption{Diagonal and lower-diagonal: posterior marginal and joint distributions of the calibration parameters described in section \ref{?}. Diagonal entries show the posterior likelihood distribution of each parameter marginalized over remaining parameters, while lower-diagonal entries show the joint distribution of parameter pairs. Upper diagonal: the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient $\rho_{X,Y}=\text{cov}(X,Y)/(\sigma_X \sigma_Y)$ for each pair of parameters $X$, $Y$. Red (blue) tiles indicate Pearson coefficients close to $1$ ($-1$) corresponding to strong linear correlation (anti-correlation). $^\dagger$The units for $\eta/s$ slope are [GeV$^{-1}$].}

\appendix

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics{posterior_integrated}
    \caption{Presentation is identical to Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_identified}, but with charged particle yields replacing identified pion, kaon and proton yields in the calibration process. The resulting posterior distributions are generally less constrained, and several marginal distributions along the diagonal are affected noticeably (see Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_comparison} for a direct comparison). For example, the initial condition normalization increases significantly (top-left panel) and the hydro-to-urqmd switching temperature is completely washed out (bottom-right panel). $^\dagger$The units for $\eta/s$ slope are [GeV$^{-1}$]. }
